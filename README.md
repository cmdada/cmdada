Hi, I’m Ada and my username on most things is **cmd**.  
If you're looking for my Linux kernel contributions, those were under **cmdada@proton.me**.

I'm team captain of the **Robosharks MATE ROV** team, and a senior electrical member of **FRC Team 2036 — the Boulder Valley Black Knights**.

Most of my work isn’t programming, but I enjoy some webdev in my free time and am the owner of  
[@Team1157](https://github.com/Team1157/) and [@team2036](https://github.com/team2036/).
