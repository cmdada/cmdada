- Hi, Iâ€™m Ada and my username on most things is cmd. if you're looking for my linux kernel contributions, those were under cmdada@proton.me
- I use github as a dumping ground for random code, so don't expect much
- i have a questionable about me [here](http://about.poweredge.xyz/)(it really doesnt have much info)
- my three sites are adabit.org, poweredge.xyz and adas.software (adabit and adas.software are more functional than poweredge)
