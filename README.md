<p style="color: #ee2e2e;">Hi, Iâ€™m Ada and my username on most things is cmd. if you're looking for my linux kernel contributions, those were under cmdada@proton.me</p>
I'm team captain of the Robosharks MATE ROV team, and a senior electrical member of FRC Team 2036 the Boulder Valley Black Knights.
Most of my work is not dealing with programming, but I enjoy some webdev in my free time and am the owner of [@Team1157](https://github.com/Team1157/) and [@team2036](https://github.com/team2036)
