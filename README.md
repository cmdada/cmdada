<p style="color: #ee2e2e;">Hi, Iâ€™m Ada and my username on most things is cmd. if you're looking for my linux kernel contributions, those were under cmdada@proton.me</p>

I use github as a dumping ground for random code, so don't expect much

i have too many domains ([my main site](https://adabit.org), [adarun](https://poweredge.xyz), [my git](https://adas.software), https://bhsgsa.org)
